#"Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots"

This project was created as part of "Summer Analytics 2025" hosted by the "Consulting & Analytics Club × Pathway" at IIT Guwahati.

It implements a "real-time, data-driven pricing system" for 14 urban parking spaces using Python, Pathway, and Bokeh.
The dataset used for addressing the problem statement is provided as an attachment under the filename dataset.csv.


#"Project Overview"

Urban parking lots often suffer from poor utilization due to fixed pricing.
This project builds a dynamic pricing engine that adjusts in real time based on factors like occupancy, queue length, traffic conditions, vehicle type and special events/festivals.
I built three models, increasing in complexity and intelligence. The working principles of all three models are briefly described in the attached report, "Capstone_Project_SA_2025.pdf".


#"Tech Stack Used"

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and numerical operations
- Pathway – Real-time data streaming and processing
- Bokeh – Real-time visualization
- Google Colab – Execution and testing
- Git & GitHub – Version control and repository hosting

#"Working Code"
The complete working code for all the models has been provided in the attached Jupyter notebook named "Project_capston.ipynb".
